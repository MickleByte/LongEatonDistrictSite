                            We will normally only share personal information with adult volunteers holding an appointment in the Long Eaton District

                            We will normally only share personal information with adult volunteers holding appropriate appointments within the line management structure of The Scout Association for Long Eaton as well as with The Scout Association Headquarters as joint data controllers.

                        <p>
                            We will however share your personal information with others outside of Long Eaton Scouts where we need meet a legal obligation. This may include The Scout Association and its insurance subsidiary (Unity Insurance Services), local authority services and
                            law enforcement. We will only share your personal information to the extent needed for those purposes. We will only share your data with third parties outside of the organisation where there is a legitimate reason to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will never sell your personal information to any third party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes we may nominate a member for national awards, (such as Scouting awards or Duke of Edinburgh's awards) such nominations would require us to provide contact details to that organisation.

                        <p>
                            Where personal data is shared with third parties we will seek assurances that your personal data will be kept confidential and that the third party fully complies with the GDPR and DPA 2018.

                    <h1 class="bigSubtitle">How we store your personal data</h1>
                    <p>
                        We generally store personal information in the following ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compass is the online membership system of The Scout Association, this system is used for the collection and storage of adult volunteer personal data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In addition adult volunteers will hold some personal data on local spreadsheets/ databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Printed records and data held while attending events - paper is sometimes used to capture and retain some data for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gift Aid administration</li>
                        <li>Event registration</li>
                        <li>Health and contact records forms (for events)</li>
                        <li>Events coordination with event organisers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Paper records for events are used rather than relying on secure digital systems, as often the events are held where internet and digital access will not be available. We will minimise the use of paper to only what is required for the event.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h1 class="bigSubtitle">Further processing</h1>
                    <p>
                        If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose, not covered by this Data Protection Notice, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing the processing and setting out the relevant purposes and processing
                        conditions. Where and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior consent to the new processing.

                    </p>

                        <li>The right to access your personal data. You can ask us to share with you the data we have about you. This is a Data Subject Access Request.</li>
                        <li>The right to rectification. This just means you can update your data if it is inaccurate or if something is missing. Adult members will be able to edit and update some information directly on The Scout Associations Compass membership
                            system
                        </li>
                        <li>The right to erasure. This means that you have the right to request that we delete any personal data we have about you. There are some exceptions, for example, some information will be held by The Scout Association for legal reasons</li>
                        <li>The right to restrict processing. If you think that we are not processing your data in line with this privacy notice then you have the right to restrict any further use of that data until the issue is resolved</li>
                        <li>The right to data portability. This means that if you ask us we will have to share your data with you in a way that can be read digitally, such as a pdf. This makes it easier to share information with others</li>
                        <li>The right to object. You can object to the ways your data is being used</li>
                        <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. This protects you in cases where decision are being made about you based entirely on automated processes rather than a human input. It is highly unlikely that this
